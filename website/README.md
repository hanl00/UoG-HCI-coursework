# HCI assessed exercise

The aim of this coursework is to make and demonstrate an interactive system that allows people to monitor, understand or support good
health—or lets us understand and work against bad health—or otherwise uses health data to make our lives more
enjoyable or productive.

The project is focused on the topic of COVID, e.g. its spread
and key risk factors, as documented by institutions such as the World Health Organisation, the EU and the UK
government.

We have modified an existing template to build our idea for this project.
The templates' source code can be found at https://github.com/GeoForum/veiledning08
